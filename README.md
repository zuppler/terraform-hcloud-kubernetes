<!-- Security -->
### :shield: Security
Talos Linux is a secure, minimal, and immutable OS for Kubernetes, removing SSH and shell access to reduce attack surfaces. Managed through a secure API with mTLS, Talos prevents configuration drift, enhancing both security and predictability. It follows [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/publications/application-container-security-guide) and [CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes) hardening standards, operates in memory, and is built to support modern, production-grade Kubernetes environments.

**Firewall Protection:** This module uses [Hetzner Cloud Firewalls](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/firewalls/) to manage external access to nodes. For internal pod-to-pod communication, support for Kubernetes Network Policies is provided through [Cilium CNI](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/kubernetes/policy/).

**Encryption in Transit:** In this module, all pod network traffic is encrypted by default using [WireGuard via Cilium CNI](https://cilium.io/use-cases/transparent-encryption/). It includes automatic key rotation and efficient in-kernel encryption, covering all traffic types.

**Encryption at Rest:** In this module, the [STATE](https://www.talos.dev/latest/learn-more/architecture/#file-system-partitions) and [EPHEMERAL](https://www.talos.dev/latest/learn-more/architecture/#file-system-partitions) partitions are encrypted by default with [Talos Disk Encryption](https://www.talos.dev/latest/talos-guides/configuration/disk-encryption/) using LUKS2. Each node is secured with individual encryption keys derived from its unique `nodeID`.

terraform state rm 'module.kubernetes.talos_machine_secrets.this'
terraform destroy
```

<!-- Advanced Configuration -->
## :hammer_and_pick: Advanced Configuration

<!-- Cluster Access -->
<details>
<summary><b>Cluster Access</b></summary>

#### Public Cluster Access
By default, the cluster is accessible over the public internet. The firewall is automatically configured to use the IPv4 address and /64 IPv6 CIDR of the machine running this module. To disable this automatic configuration, set the following variables to `false`:

```hcl
firewall_use_current_ipv4 = false
firewall_use_current_ipv6 = false
```

To manually specify source networks for the Talos API and Kube API, configure the `firewall_talos_api_source` and `firewall_kube_api_source` variables as follows:
```hcl
firewall_talos_api_source = [
  "1.2.3.0/32",
  "1:2:3::/64"
]
firewall_kube_api_source = [
  "1.2.3.0/32",
  "1:2:3::/64"
]
```
This allows explicit control over which networks can access your APIs, overriding the default behavior when set.

#### Internal Cluster Access
If your internal network is routed and accessible, you can directly access the cluster using internal IPs by setting:
```hcl
cluster_access = "private"
```

For integrating Talos nodes with an internal network, configure a default route (`0.0.0.0/0`) in the Hetzner Network to point to your router or gateway. Additionally, add specific routes on the Talos nodes to encompass your entire network CIDR:
```hcl
talos_extra_routes = ["10.0.0.0/8"]

# Optionally, disable NAT for your globally routed CIDR
network_native_routing_cidr = "10.0.0.0/8"

# Optionally, use an existing Network
hcloud_network_id = 123456789
```
This setup ensures that the Talos nodes can route traffic appropriately across your internal network.


#### Access to Kubernetes API

Optionally, a hostname can be configured to direct access to the Kubernetes API through a node IP, load balancer, or Virtual IP (VIP):
```hcl
kube_api_hostname = "kube-api.example.com"
```

##### Access from Public Internet
For accessing the Kubernetes API from the public internet, choose one of the following options based on your needs:
1. **Use a Load Balancer (Recommended):**<br>
    Deploy a load balancer to manage API traffic, enhancing availability and load distribution.
    ```hcl
    kube_api_load_balancer_enabled = true
    ```
2. **Use a Virtual IP (Floating IP):**<br>
    A Floating IP is configured to automatically move between control plane nodes in case of an outage, ensuring continuous access to the Kubernetes API.
    ```hcl
    control_plane_public_vip_ipv4_enabled = true

    # Optionally, specify an existing Floating IP
    control_plane_public_vip_ipv4_id = 123456789
    ```

##### Access from Internal Network
When accessing the Kubernetes API via an internal network, an internal Virtual IP (Alias IP) is utilized by default to route API requests within the network. This feature can be disabled with the following configuration:
```hcl
control_plane_private_vip_ipv4_enabled = false
```

To enhance internal availability, a load balancer can be used:
```hcl
kube_api_load_balancer_enabled = true
```

This setup ensures secure and flexible access to the Kubernetes API, accommodating different networking environments.
</details>

<!-- Cluster Autoscaler -->
<details>
<summary><b>Cluster Autoscaler</b></summary>
The Cluster Autoscaler dynamically adjusts the number of nodes in a Kubernetes cluster based on the demand, ensuring that there are enough nodes to run all pods and no unneeded nodes when the workload decreases.

Example `kubernetes.tf` snippet:
```hcl
# Configuration for cluster autoscaler node pools
cluster_autoscaler_nodepools = [
  {
    name     = "autoscaler"
    type     = "cpx11"
    location = "fsn1"
    min      = 0
    max      = 6
    labels   = { "autoscaler-node" = "true" }
    taints   = [ "autoscaler-node=true:NoExecute" ]
  }
]
```

Optionally, pass additional [Helm values](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/charts/cluster-autoscaler/values.yaml) to the cluster autoscaler configuration:
```hcl
cluster_autoscaler_helm_values = {
  extraArgs = {
    enforce-node-group-min-size   = true
    scale-down-delay-after-add    = "45m"
    scale-down-delay-after-delete = "4m"
    scale-down-unneeded-time      = "5m"
  }
}
```
</details>

<!-- Egress Gateway -->
<details>
<summary><b>Egress Gateway</b></summary>

Cilium offers an Egress Gateway to ensure network compatibility with legacy systems and firewalls requiring fixed IPs. The use of Cilium Egress Gateway does not provide high availability and increases latency due to extra network hops and tunneling. Consider this configuration only as a last resort.

Example `kubernetes.tf` snippet:
```hcl
# Enable Cilium Egress Gateway
cilium_egress_gateway_enabled = true

# Define worker nodepools including an egress-specific node pool
worker_nodepools = [
  # ... (other node pool configurations)
  {
    name     = "egress"
    type     = "cpx11"
    location = "fsn1"
    labels   = { "egress-node" = "true" }
    taints   = [ "egress-node=true:NoSchedule" ]
  }
]
```

Example Egress Gateway Policy:
```yml
apiVersion: cilium.io/v2
kind: CiliumEgressGatewayPolicy
metadata:
  name: sample-egress-policy
spec:
  selectors:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          io.kubernetes.pod.namespace: sample-namespace
          app: sample-app

  destinationCIDRs:
    - "0.0.0.0/0"

  egressGateway:
    nodeSelector:
      matchLabels:
        egress-node: "true"
```

Please visit the Cilium [documentation](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/egress-gateway) for more details.
</details>

<!-- Firewall Configuration -->
<details>
<summary><b>Firewall Configuration</b></summary>
By default, a firewall is configured that can be extended with custom rules. If no egress rules are configured, outbound traffic remains unrestricted. However, inbound traffic is always restricted to mitigate the risk of exposing Talos nodes to the public internet, which could pose a serious security vulnerability.

Each rule is defined with the following properties:
- `description`: A brief description of the rule.
- `direction`: The direction of traffic (`in` for inbound, `out` for outbound).
- `source_ips`: A list of source IP addresses for outbound rules.
- `destination_ips`: A list of destination IP addresses for inbound rules.
- `protocol`: The protocol used (valid options: `tcp`, `udp`, `icmp`, `gre`, `esp`).
- `port`: The port number (required for `tcp` and `udp` protocols, must not be specified for `icmp`, `gre`, and `esp`).

Example `kubernetes.tf` snippet:
```hcl
firewall_extra_rules = [
  {
    description = "Custom UDP Rule"
    direction   = "in"
    source_ips  = ["0.0.0.0/0", "::/0"]
    protocol    = "udp"
    port        = "12345"
  },
  {
    description = "Custom TCP Rule"
    direction   = "in"
    source_ips  = ["1.2.3.4", "1:2:3:4::"]
    protocol    = "tcp"
    port        = "8080-9000"
  },
  {
    description = "Allow ICMP"
    direction   = "in"
    source_ips  = ["0.0.0.0/0", "::/0"]
    protocol    = "icmp"
  }
]
```

For access to Talos and the Kubernetes API, please refer to the [Cluster Access](#public-cluster-access) configuration section.

</details>

<!-- Ingress Load Balancer -->
<details>
<summary><b>Ingress Load Balancer</b></summary>

The ingress controller uses a default load balancer service to manage external traffic. For geo-redundancy and high availability, `ingress_load_balancer_pools` can be configured as an alternative, replacing the default load balancer with the specified pool of load balancers.

##### Configuring Load Balancer Pools
To replace the default load balancer, use `ingress_load_balancer_pools` in the Terraform configuration. This setup ensures high availability and geo-redundancy by distributing traffic from various locations across all targets in all regions.

Example `kubernetes.tf` configuration:
```hcl
ingress_load_balancer_pools = [
  {
    name     = "lb-nbg"
    location = "nbg1"
    type     = "lb11"
  },
  {
    name     = "lb-fsn"
    location = "fsn1"
    type     = "lb11"
  }
]
```

##### Local Traffic Optimization
Configuring local traffic handling enhances network efficiency by reducing latency. Processing traffic closer to its source eliminates unnecessary routing delays, ensuring consistent performance for low-latency or region-sensitive applications.

Example `kubernetes.tf` configuration:
```hcl
ingress_nginx_kind = "DaemonSet"
ingress_nginx_service_external_traffic_policy = "Local"

ingress_load_balancer_pools = [
  {
    name          = "regional-lb-nbg"
    location      = "nbg1"
    local_traffic = true
  },
  {
    name          = "regional-lb-fsn"
    location      = "fsn1"
    local_traffic = true
  }
]
```

Key settings in this configuration:
- `local_traffic`: Limits load balancer targets to nodes in the same geographic location as the load balancer, reducing data travel distances and keeping traffic within the region.
- `ingress_nginx_service_external_traffic_policy` set to `Local`: Ensures external traffic is handled directly on the local node, avoiding extra network hops.
- `ingress_nginx_kind` set to `DaemonSet`: Deploys an ingress controller instance on every node, enabling requests to be handled locally for faster response times.

Topology-aware routing in ingress-nginx can optionally be enabled by setting the `ingress_nginx_topology_aware_routing` variable to `true`. This functionality routes traffic to the nearest upstream endpoints, enhancing efficiency for supported services. Note that this feature is only applicable to services that support topology-aware routing. For more information, refer to the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/topology-aware-routing/).

</details>

<!-- Network Segmentation -->
<details>
<summary><b>Network Segmentation</b></summary>

By default, this module calculates optimal subnets based on the provided network CIDR (`network_ipv4_cidr`). The network is segmented automatically as follows:

- **1st Quarter**: Reserved for other uses such as classic VMs.
- **2nd Quarter**:
  - **1st Half**: Allocated for Node Subnets (`network_node_ipv4_cidr`)
  - **2nd Half**: Allocated for Service IPs (`network_service_ipv4_cidr`)
- **3rd and 4th Quarters**:
  - **Full Span**: Allocated for Pod Subnets (`network_pod_ipv4_cidr`)

Each Kubernetes node requires a `/24` subnet within `network_pod_ipv4_cidr`. To support this configuration, the optimal node subnet size (`network_node_ipv4_subnet_mask_size`) is calculated using the formula:<br>
32 - (24 - subnet_mask_size(`network_pod_ipv4_cidr`)).

With the default `10.0.0.0/16` network CIDR (`network_ipv4_cidr`), the following values are calculated:
- **Node Subnet Size**: `/25` (Max. 128 Nodes per Subnet)
- **Node Subnets**: `10.0.64.0/19` (Max. 64 Subnets, each with `/25`)
- **Service IPs**: `10.0.96.0/19` (Max. 8192 Services)
- **Pod Subnet Size**: `/24` (Max. 256 Pods per Node)
- **Pod Subnets**: `10.0.128.0/17` (Max. 128 Nodes, each with `/24`)

Please consider the following Hetzner Cloud limits:
- Up to **100 servers** can be attached to a network.
- Up to **100 routes** can be created per network.
- Up to **50 subnets** can be created per network.
- A project can have up to **50 placement groups**.

A `/16` Network CIDR is sufficient to fully utilize Hetzner Cloud's scaling capabilities. It supports:
- Up to 100 nodes, each with its own `/24` Pod subnet route.
- Configuration of up to 50 nodepools, one nodepool per subnet, each with at least one placement group.


Here is a table with more example calculations:
| Network CIDR    | Node Subnet Size | Node Subnets      | Service IPs         | Pod Subnets         |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| **10.0.0.0/16** | /25 (128 IPs)    | 10.0.64.0/19 (64) | 10.0.96.0/19 (8192) | 10.0.128.0/17 (128) |
| **10.0.0.0/17** | /26 (64 IPs)     | 10.0.32.0/20 (64) | 10.0.48.0/20 (4096) | 10.0.64.0/18 (64)   |
| **10.0.0.0/18** | /27 (32 IPs)     | 10.0.16.0/21 (64) | 10.0.24.0/21 (2048) | 10.0.32.0/19 (32)   |
| **10.0.0.0/19** | /28 (16 IPs)     | 10.0.8.0/22  (64) | 10.0.12.0/22 (1024) | 10.0.16.0/20 (16)   |
| **10.0.0.0/20** | /29 (8 IPs)      | 10.0.4.0/23  (64) | 10.0.6.0/23 (512)   | 10.0.8.0/21 (8)     |

This module natively supports Hcloud Object Storage. Below is an example of how to configure backups with [MinIO Client](https://github.com/minio/mc?tab=readme-ov-file#homebrew) (`mc`) and Hcloud Object Storage. While it's possible to create the bucket through the [Hcloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud), this method does not allow for the configuration of automatic retention policies.

Create an alias for the endpoint using the following command:
```sh
mc alias set <alias> \
  https://<location>.your-objectstorage.com \
  <access-key> <secret-key> \
  --api "s3v4" \
  --path "off"
```

Create a bucket with automatic retention policies to protect your backups:
```sh
mc mb --with-lock --region <location> <alias>/<bucket>
mc retention set GOVERNANCE 14d --default <alias>/<bucket>
```

Configure your `kubernetes.tf` file:
```hcl
talos_backup_s3_hcloud_url = "https://<bucket>.<location>.your-objectstorage.com"
talos_backup_s3_access_key = "<access-key>"
talos_backup_s3_secret_key = "<secret-key>"

# Optional: AGE X25519 Public Key for encryption
talos_backup_age_x25519_public_key = "<age-public-key>"

# Optional: Change schedule (cron syntax)
talos_backup_schedule = "0 * * * *"
```

For users of other object storage providers, configure `kubernetes.tf` as follows:
```hcl
talos_backup_s3_region   = "<region>"
talos_backup_s3_endpoint = "<endpoint>"
talos_backup_s3_bucket   = "<bucket>"
talos_backup_s3_prefix   = "<prefix>"

# Use path-style URLs (set true if required by your provider)
talos_backup_s3_path_style = true

# Access credentials
talos_backup_s3_access_key = "<access-key>"
talos_backup_s3_secret_key = "<secret-key>"

# Optional: AGE X25519 Public Key for encryption
talos_backup_age_x25519_public_key = "<age-public-key>"

# Optional: Change schedule (cron syntax)
talos_backup_schedule = "0 * * * *"
```

<!-- Lifecycle -->
## :recycle: Lifecycle
The [Talos Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/siderolabs/talos) does not support declarative upgrades of Talos or Kubernetes versions. This module compensates for these limitations using `talosctl` to implement the required functionalities. Any minor or major upgrades to Talos and Kubernetes will result in a major version change of this module. Please be aware that downgrades are typically neither supported nor tested.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before upgrading to the next major version of this module, ensure you are on the latest release of the current major version. Do not skip any major release upgrades.

In this module, upgrades are conducted with care and conservatism. You will consistently receive the most tested and compatible releases of all components, avoiding the latest untested or incompatible releases that could disrupt your cluster.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not change any software versions in this project on your own. Each component is tailored to ensure compatibility with new Kubernetes releases. This project specifies versions that are supported and have been thoroughly tested to work together.

<!-- Roadmap -->
## :compass: Roadmap

* [ ] **Upgrade to Talos 1.8 and Kubernetes 1.31**<br>
      Once all components have compatible versions, the upgrade can be performed.
* [ ] **Integrate native IPv6 for pod traffic**<br>
      Completion requires Hetzner's addition of IPv6 support to cloud networks, expected at the beginning of 2025 as announced at Hetzner Summit 2024.
